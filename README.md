# MinesweeperHTML
 A minesweeper game written in HTML, CSS and JS.

# Basic feature
 This game will have a grid of clickable cells for player to clear, meanwhile some cells contain a mine/bomb which will lead to 'Game over' situation. The objective is clearing all cells without detonating any bomb.

# Challenge tasks
 ## Sound effect feature
  There will be a sound played after player clicks on a cell. Different sounds will be played depending on a cell contains a bomb or not.
 ## Reveal neighbour cells feature
  Exposes a cell with the number of surrounding bombs. If no bomb is surrounded, it would be no number marked and expose all neighbour cells by recalling this function on them until all cells are marked with a number.
 ## Flag feature
  Player can flag a cell to denote there is a bomb in it and avoid misclicking on flagged cells afterward.
